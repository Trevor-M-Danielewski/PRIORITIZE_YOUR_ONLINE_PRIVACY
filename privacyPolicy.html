                For legal reasons, <u>this entire privacy policy page is satire</u>.
                Absolutely zero information is collected from navigating, accepting, or inputting anything on this website.
                This is a website I developed for a class project.

            Anyone can be all nice and sweet. They can paint a facade and tell you to trust them. But it is easier to
            tell part of the truth or even lie and deceive online than it is in person.
            <br><br>
            Why would you trust a stranger with your personal information?
            <br><br>
            What happens if they don't secure it?
            <br>
            What happens if they lose it?
            <br>
            What happens if they share it?
            <br>
            What happens if they sell it?

            <br><br>
            You <u>aren't</u> the one behind the scenes of that company.
            You will <u>never</u> truly know how your data is handled.
            You <u>aren't</u> the only one who has access to your data.

            <br><br>
            <strong>You are entitled to your right of privacy. So use it.</strong>
