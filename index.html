        Project: Term Project

        Description:
            This is my term project for ITEC 231. The project is to build a website that is focused on a specific topic.
            However, we are required to select one of the three themes with our topic. The themes are:

                1. Censorship
                2. Copyright Laws
                3. Internet Laws

            I chose the topic of online privacy and the theme of internet laws. I find it extremely important for
            everyone to understand the importance of online privacy, and not many people have the knowledge of
            how their personal information is being used. This website is to help educate people on basic internet
            laws that coincide with online privacy.

            Especially for those who are not as tech-savvy, I am hoping that this website will help them understand
            to some extent. But to also provide some resources for those who are willing to begin, or improve,
            protecting their online privacy.

            <h2>What is Online Privacy?</h2>

            <p>
                Online privacy, a major concern for many, refers to the ability to control
                what information you share online and who can access it. This includes personal
                details such as your name, address, phone number, and email address, as well as
                data like your browsing history, search queries, and social media activity. With
                the rise of social media and the internet, it's easier than ever for our online activity
                to be seen, leading to potential privacy loss, security risks, and even identity theft.
            </p>

            <p>
                There are many laws and regulations in place to protect online privacy, but
                most of the laws are set for large corporations and not for individuals. This is
                where large corporations can still make a profit off of your personal information.
                Companies can track your online activity and collect data about your online behavior
                through their websites, apps, and other online services. With this they can sell your
                information to other companies, use it for targeted advertising, and gain more revenue.
                All through their customer's personal information.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong><u>You are entitled to your privacy rights, and it is withing your rights to exercise and protect them.</u></strong>
            </p>

            <p>

            <h2>Why is Online Privacy Important?</h2>
            <p>
                Online privacy is absolutely crucial for many reasons. Primarily,
                everyone is entitled to their right to privacy, and this extends to the digital world.
                Millions of people's information is sold to massive data brokers every day, and this is
                through many of the websites and apps that we use.
            </p>
            <p>
                A large number of companies that have access to your information, subsequently selling
                it to others, increases the risk of data leaks. In some instances, your personal data
                might be compromised due to a breach in a company's security, a company you might not
                even be aware has your information. Just like that. Your personal data is on the dark web.
            </p>

            <p>
                It is not just about controlling what information you share online, but it's also
                about protecting your personal information, your identity, and your security from
                potential threats in the digital world. It's a fundamental aspect of your digital
                life that helps maintain your integrity and safety in a rapidly evolving digital
                world where technological advancements nearly quadruple each year.
