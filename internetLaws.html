        <h2>Internet Laws</h2>
        <p>
            The internet is a vast and complex place, and as such, it is subject to a wide range of
            laws and regulations. These laws are designed to protect the rights and privacy of internet
            users, as well as to ensure that the internet remains a safe and secure environment for all.

        <h3>The 1974 Privacy Act</h3>
        <p>
            The Privacy Act of 1974 is a federal law that establishes a code of fair information practices
            that governs the collection, maintenance, use, and dissemination of information about individuals
            that is maintained in systems of records by federal agencies. The Privacy Act requires that agencies
            give the public notice of their systems of records by publication in the Federal Register. The Privacy
            Act prohibits the disclosure of information from a system of records absent the written consent of the
            subject individual, unless the disclosure is pursuant to one of twelve statutory exceptions.
