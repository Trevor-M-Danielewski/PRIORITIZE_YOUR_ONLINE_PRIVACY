            <h2>Data Collection Laws</h2>
            <p>
                Data collection laws are designed to regulate the collection, use, and sharing of
                personal data by organizations. These laws are intended to protect the privacy and
                security of individuals' personal information and to ensure that it is not misused or
                disclosed without their consent. Some of the key data collection laws that you should
                be aware of include:
            </p>
            <h3>Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act</h3>
            <p>
                This act requires the FTC, along with federal banking agencies, to establish standards
                to protect the privacy of financial institutions information regarding their consumers'
                personal information. It is required that they must provide notice to customers annually
                regarding their privacy policies and practices, and before they share any information with
                non-affiliated third parties.

                <br><br>
                It requires these institutions to allow customers to opt out of the sharing of their information
                with non-affiliated third parties. This is coupled with the regulations of protecting the security
                of consumer's personal information and even limits the disclosure of account number information.

                <br><br>
                On top of protecting the privacy of consumer's information, it prohibited the use of fraudulent
                statements and practices in order to collect personal information.

            <h3>California Consumer Privacy Act</h3>
            <p>
                Established in 2018, the California Consumer Privacy Act grants consumers significantly more
                control over their personal information that is collected by businesses. The key privacy rights
                for California consumers includes:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>The right to know what personal information is being collected about them</li>
                <li>The right to know how personal information is being shared</li>
                <li>The right to delete personal information collected by companies</li>
                <li>The right to op-out of the sale or sharing of personal information</li>
                <li>The right to protection against discrimination for the exercising of these rights</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                This act was a massive step forward in the protection of consumer's personal information.
                It was the first of its kind in the United States, and it has inspired other states to incorporate
                similar laws to protect their residents. However, only a few states have followed since the enactment.
                Hopefully, more states will follow and protect their residents' personal information.

            <h3>Maryland Consumer Protection Act</h3>
            <p>
                This act was enacted in 2023, and it is designed to protect consumers from unfair or deceptive
                trade methods. It prohibits unfair or deceptive tactics such as, but not limited to:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Misrepresentation</li>
                <li>Omission of important information</li>
                <li>Methods of selling</li>
                <li>Type of transaction</li>
                <li>Conduct during transaction</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Data protection laws serve as the backbone of our digital privacy and security, ensuring that consumers
                are being presented with the fair treatment they deserve. These laws are designed to protect our personal
                information from misuse and abuse, giving us the power to control how our data is collected, used, and shared.

                <br><br>
                These laws encourage businesses to implement strong security measures, protecting our data
                from cyber threats. They hold organizations accountable for their data practices, imposing
                penalties for non-compliance.
